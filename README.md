This is my github portfolio. Here you will find the work that I have completed for the MIT XPRO Full Stack Development w/MERN program. This portfolio was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also used Bootstrap5 and google fonts which I learned how to incorporate while completing the modules and assignments. I have learned these 3 languages throughout the duration of this course thus far. On the portfolio page, you can find the applications, cool things about me, and my contact information as well. This repo is for educational purposes only. thank you
